# :postbox: Faq

**Question:** What are the technologies used in this project?

**Answer:** The tecnologies used in this project are [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [Firebase Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database?hl=pt-br) to retrieve products data and [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/api/motion/) for page transitions.

## :hammer: Deploy
[Zeit](https://zeit.co/) provides a easy way to deploy NextJS applications. You may create a now.json file with the build configuration.

```
{
    "build": {
        "env": {
            "SITE_URL": "@site_url",
            "FIREBASE_API_KEY": "@firebase_api_key",
            "FIREBASE_APP_KEY": "@firebase_app_id",
            "FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID": "@firebase_measurement_id",
            "FIREBASE_MESSAGE_SENDER_ID": "@firebase_message_sender_id"
        }
    }
}
```

You're able to create secrets with the commands provided by the [Now CLI](https://zeit.co/download) in order to map environment variables, 

```
now secrets add <secret-name> <secret-value>
```

Use them as the values of the env variables that you want to map inside of the build configuration.
